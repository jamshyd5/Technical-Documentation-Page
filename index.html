			<p>A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1][2] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</p>

			<header>BASH (UNIX SHELL)</header>
			<p>Used to interact with and manage Linux and Unix system at the command line.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces and the notion of being "born again".</li>
			</ul>
			<pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
STR="Hello World!"
echo $STR

			<header>BASIC</header>
			<p>Basic was first released in 1964 and reached its heyday in the early 80s, when computers were starting to enter the small office and the home. You were expected to write your own software and the large majority of computers shipped with some version of BASIC. It hit the sweet spot of being easy to learn but lean enough to run on this underpowered hardware.</p>


			<p>There are a huge number of BASIC variants, Visual Basic was a variation that was very popular on Windows in the 90s. This was replaced by Visual Basic .NET (now called just Visual Basic) but was quite different from the earlier versions. Visual Basic is still widely used.</p>

			<pre><code>
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 END
			</code></pre>

		<section class="main-section" id="C">
			<header>C</header>
			<p>The most important language in the world. It’s what operating systems like Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android are written in, as well as browsers and 3D games engines. Its syntax has influenced countless other programming languages.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C maps closely to Assembly Language but you can write more complex programmes with it. If you need the highest performance possible without losing your mind then C is for you.</li>
				<li>C is also the language that made “Hello, World” examples popular.</li>
			</ul>
			<pre><code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
printf("hello, world\n");
}
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="C++">
			<header>C++</header>
			<p>Has performance close to C and is used in many important projects like the Chrome Browser. C++ was an effort to make a language that was easier to build large projects with while still being fast and efficient.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.</li>
			</ul>
			<pre><code>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
    return 0;
}
			</code></pre>

		<section class="main-section" id="C#">
			<header>C#</header>
			<p>C# (pronounced as C sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It is one of the most popular languages used for developing desktop and web applications.</p>
			<p>Created when Microsoft built their .Net virtual machine. C# has become Microsoft premier programming language.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.</li>
				<li>Being a C based language, C# is closer to C++ and C. Syntactically, it is similar to Java.</li>
			</ul>
			<pre><code>
using System;

class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
	}
}
		</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="JAVA">
			<header>JAVA</header>
			<p>Something that made Java special is that it was designed so you could write code once and then allow it to run on any operation system. Java is the most popular programming language in the world. It’s used to teach students and in large companies. All Android apps are written in Java.</p>
			<pre><code>
class HelloWorldApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
	}
}
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="JAVASCRIPT-(ECMASCRIPT)">
			<header>JAVASCRIPT (ECMASCRIPT)</header>
			<p>JavaScript is the most commonly found programming language in the world. Mainly because it is required to be in every web browser. JavaScript is what makes the web dynamic and interactive. It was standardised under the name ECMAScript.</p>
			<pre><code>console.log("Hello World!");</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="PHP">
			<header>PHP</header>
			<p>PHP is the most popular language for building the backend of websites. It’s what Facebook and WordPress are written in. Facebook decided to create their own dialect of PHP called Hack.</p>
			<pre><code>?php echo "Hello, World";</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="PYTHON">
			<header>PYTHON</header>
			<p>Has a compact syntax needing far fewer lines of code than languages like Java or C++. It’s very popular and is used for websites and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.</p>
			<pre><code>print("Hello World")</code></pre>
